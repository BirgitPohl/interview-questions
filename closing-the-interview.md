## Question time

Give the candidate enough time for questions. 

ðŸ”¥ Tip:  Arrange your calendar, that you can expand the time. Give 30 minutes more than expected.

## Feedback round
1. Was it too technical or too abstract?
2. Can you give me some feedback on the interview approach? b. Do you have any suggestions on how this could be improved?
