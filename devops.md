## LONG AWS:
Given the situation that we need to rapidly need to build an application to handle the following:
A partly Germany / partly US based customer of ours runs several eCommerce sites in AWS which should all be connected to a single API and persisting sensitive data. The API needs to be written. The current rates are in total 20000 visitors per day per site and 5000 req/s â€“ however since the customer aims to enlarge their company it is quite likely that this needs to scale in the next month and years.

The data should be able to be easily taken and to be analyzed and displayed to the customer. What tooling would you use for that?

Also the customer complains about performance of the website. Especially the initial loading time is in some areas in the US quite terrible.
What would you advise him to do?

How should the initial overall architecture look like from your pov?
